# PYTHON AND MACHINE LEARNING NATIONAL WORKSHOP
Hi I attended 7 Days National Workshop on "Python And Machine Learning" from 07-13 June 2021, conducted by <b> THE CODE SCHOLAR</b>.

<br>I got to have hands on experience on:
<li>Python
<li>Machine Learning
<li>Project Understanding
<br>
During these 7 days, everything was explained from the very basics so that
anyone with zero experience on programming can learn.
  
The instructor during the session was Mr. Nitesh. 
<br>Speakers from different industry domains, lightened up the session with their experience. 
I got to learn a lot during these 7 days and it was an amazing experience learning with THE CODE SCHOLAR.<br>

<br><br>Here's the link for you to watch the sessions as well<br>
